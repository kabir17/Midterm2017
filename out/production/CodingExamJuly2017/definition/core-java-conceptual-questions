Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
-Jdk contains everything that is in the JRE and tools such as compiler,debuggers.
 Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the javac compiler.The bytecode gets saved on the disk with file extension class and bytecode converted by using jit compiler.
 Java debugger is interface. java debug write protocol.

What is IDE?
-A java IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.It is a software application which write and debug java programs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
-IDEs are available Eclipse,Intellij,Netbeans,BlueJ,Oracle etc.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
-The Java lifeCycle :
1.Input Unit : Receives data from the input devices such as the keyboard,mouse and any other peripherals.
2.Memory Unit: Ram is called memory units.It provides fast access storage of computer programs,data and data to be sent to the output devices.
3.Arithmetic and logic unit: performs the arithmetic calculation on data in memory,such as addition,subtraction,division and comparison.
4.Central Processing unit : Manages the other units by sending messagees to the input unit to read data into the memory unit.
5.Storage Unit : Stores and reads data and programs in long-term storage to be used at a later time.
6.Output Unit: Sends information from the computer to make it available outside of the computer.

what is class?
-A class is blu print of an object.

What is object?
-Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
-An entry point is where control is transferred from the operating system to a computer program such as processor enters a program and execution begins.

Why main is static?
-Execute starts from here without creating any instance of a class which contains the main method.If main method were not declared Static than JVM has to create instance of main class.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
-Difference between abstract class and interface in java: Interface are implicitly abstract but no implementation. while abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default
 behavior. Interface declared default final variables while abstract class contain non-final variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
-Can not make an object from an Interface and abstract class. In a concrete class interface should be implements and  in abstract class should be by using extends keyword.

what is Access Specifier?
-The keyword public,private and protected are called access specifiers.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
-Oop stands for Object oriented program.It is a programming language.It has four features: 1)Inheritance 2)abstraction 3)encapsulation and 4) Polymorphism .
 Define each oop :
 1.Inheritance - It refers to a feature that lets you create classes that are derived from other classes.The class that is inherited is the parent class,the base class or superclass.
   It has three types inheritance which are : a) single b)multi level c) hierarchical.
 2.Abstract class-When we talk about abstract class then it class.It declare method.We can define the method but cannot create an object.Abstract class will be use in concrete class by using extends keyword.
 3.Encapsulation-It is known as data hidding.Declare the variables as private in a class.It provides public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
 4.Polymorphism- a) Method Overloading- It happens in compile time. Method contain the same name and different arguments.Java will know which one to call by seeing what arguments we passed in.
                 b) Method Overridding- It happens in run time.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
-In java API stands for application programming interface.It is a list of all classes and a part of JDK.It includes all packages,classes,interfaces,methods,fields and constructors.
 Map,Iterator etc.

Does java support multiple inheritance?
-No

What is method overloading and when it happens?
-Method overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name if arguments lists are different.It is similar to constructor with different arguments.
 It happens in  parameter.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
-When an error occurs within a method and that method creates an object and occurs happen in runtime system.This block of code is called an exception.
 there are two way to handle it which are try..catch with finally block and throws remoteExceptions.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
-Static is a variable in java .Static variable does not belongs to object.It belongs to class and if variable change for one person it will effect to everybody and if variable or method is static then no need to create object in main method class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
-When we declare variable or method by using keyword then we cannot re-initialize variable or method that is call final.
 The value of final variable can be initialize at three places- a) initialize where it is declared, b) Inside instance block {curly braces}, C) Constructor.

What is final, finally and finalize?
-Final   : We declare variable by using final keyword then we cannot re-initialize variable.
 Finally : After try catch block it will execute to close the file.
 Finalize: Destroy the object from the heap.

What is a constructor ?
-When we talk about OOP then we have to say about object and that object requires some memory of your ram or hard drive. This memory given by constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
-THIS keyword is a reference variable in java that refer to the current object.It can be instance variable of current class.It can be initiate current class constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java?
-Super keyword is used in subclass's constructor to initialize.It is super class constructor.Only public and protected methods can be called by the super keyword.

What is JVM stand for ?
-Java virtual machine.

What version of java are you using?
-Version 9.0.1

What is JAR stand for ?
-Java Archive

What is compile time and run time?
-The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program.This compilation process is referred to as a compile time.A compiled program can be opened and run by user this terms call runtime.

What is heap?
-The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and array is allocated.Heap known as a garbage collector.

How java manage it's memory?
-Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the aplication runs. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared,thus making spacee for new objects.JVM uses more memory than the heap.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
-String is immutable,if we try to alter their values,another object gets created,whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuffer is thread-safe.

What is Singleton class?
-Singlton pattern helps us to keep only one instance of a class at any time . The purpose of singleton is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
-Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
- Sizeof() function returns the size of a variable.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
-Were String not immutable, a connection or file would be changed and lead to serious security threat. Mutable strings could cause security problem in Reflection too, as the parameters are strings. Efficiency The hashcode of string is frequently used in Java.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
-Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object. Constructor chaining can be done in two ways: Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in same class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
-Serial and Parallel collectors cause a stop-the-world during the GC. a serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation, while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
- Just In Time compiler.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
-During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared,thus making space for new objects .JVM takes more memory than heap.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
-No guarantee.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
-Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation.Both stored in the computer's ram.
